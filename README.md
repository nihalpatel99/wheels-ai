# ShadowExtreme: Aircraft Exterior Damage App.

A generative powered gemini-pro app that identifies and 
analyses the damage of each aircraft part, provides detailed description and total overall costs. Depending on that, three levels of status are decided.

- Green: Safe to fly
- Yellow: Minor damage but safe to fly or may be grounded for several hours until repairs are done.
- Red: Must be grounded for major repair.
